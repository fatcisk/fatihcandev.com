            <p>
                The developers of the previous pool seem to have learned the
                lesson. And released a new version! Now theyâ€™re using a Uniswap
                v2 exchange as a price oracle, along with the recommended
                utility libraries. That should be enough. You start with 20 ETH
                and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The pool has a million DVT
                tokens in balance. You know what to do.

                Using the spot price as the oracle without incorporating the
                TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) functionality in Uniswap V2
                can expose the contract to potential exploits, including a
                scenario where tokens are dumped into the liquidity pool which
                is the way we are going to use to exploit this contract.
            </p>
            <p>
                PS: TWAP is a mechanism that calculates the average price of an
                asset over a specific time period. It helps mitigate the impact
                of sudden price fluctuations and provides a more accurate
                representation of the asset's value. By incorporating TWAP, the
                contract can have better protection against price manipulation.
